# 1. Introduction

The SecureSensorNode project is a complete end-to-end system designed to demonstrate how a modern engineer can build a modular, secure, and efficient embedded solution — with real hardware, real protocols, and real design decisions.

At its core, the system consists of:
- a **client node**, implemented on an STM32 microcontroller (Nucleo-F401RE), tasked with acquiring environmental data from a digital sensor (temperature and pressure);
- a **server**, written in Python, responsible for receiving, decrypting, and exposing those data via a RESTful API.

The communication between the two happens via UART — a simple serial protocol that intentionally lacks any native encryption. Why?  
Because this gives us the opportunity to implement **application-layer security**, encrypting and hashing data directly on the microcontroller, using embedded cryptographic libraries such as AES and SHA256.

But before diving into encryption, transport protocols, REST interfaces, and DevOps pipelines, we do something simple.  
We make a **LED blink**.

And no, this is not a joke.

Blinking a LED, done right, means:
- abstracting hardware with HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer),
- configuring peripherals without blocking the CPU,
- avoiding busy-waiting (`delay()`), and using `SysTick` instead,
- understanding what is generated by the IDE and what is under our control,
- reflecting on modularity, reusability, and atomicity — yes, even for a GPIO toggle.

> Engineering is not about blinking LEDs.  
> It’s about knowing *why* the LED blinks, and doing so without wasting cycles, current, or dignity.

This report documents every step of the project — not just the code, but the reasons behind each choice.  
Because in software engineering, **code without rationale is just copy-paste**.



# 2. Git Project Structure

The project is composed of **two separate repositories**, both part of the official GitHub organization for the Software Engineering course:

- [`code`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2223-SecureSensorNode/code): contains all source code, both firmware (C for STM32) and server-side components (Python).
- [`report`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2223-SecureSensorNode/report): contains this very report, written in Markdown.

This structure reflects a clean **separation of concerns**:  
the code evolves and is versioned independently from the documentation, which follows its own release cycle.

### 2.1 `code` Repository Structure

The `code` repository is organized as follows:

SecureSensorNode/
├── client/
│ └── firmware/ ← STM32CubeIDE project for Nucleo board (written in C using HAL)
├── server/ ← Microservice in Python: UART receiver + REST API
├── automation/ ← Bash scripts, Makefiles, CI configs (optional)
├── test/ ← Integration tests (TBD)
├── security/ ← Keys, crypto configs, protocol notes (TBD)
├── README.md
└── LICENSE


This layout is not accidental. It is designed to maximize:

- **modularity** (clear directory per component),
- **traceability** (Git-friendly layout, one concern per folder),
- **atomicity** (each module can be developed, tested, and versioned independently).

The use of Git is not limited to versioning — it is used to structure the entire development lifecycle:

- `README.md` describes the purpose and usage of the system.
- Commits follow a clean, English-based, informative style (`feat`, `fix`, `doc`, `refactor`).
- Future additions may include GitHub Actions for CI/CD simulation and automated testing.

Every action — from toggling a GPIO to creating a REST endpoint — is tracked, justified, and versioned.  
This is not hobbyist code. It is an engineering artifact.
